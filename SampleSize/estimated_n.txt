9593960	12	n = 12	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the pattern of cortical activity during a picture naming task. Subjects (n=12) had to covertly name either animals or furniture items. Functional scanning was performed using a conventional 1.5-Tesla whole-body MRI system. Images obtained during naming the two categories were compared using a non-parametric test. The study revealed evidence for domain-specific lexical regions in left middle, right middle and inferior frontal areas, as well as in superior and middle temporal areas. The results corroborate neuropsychological data and demonstrate directly and non-invasively in human volunteers that semantic representations in frontal and temporal areas are, to some degree, localized and possibly implemented as multiple maps. A completely distributed storage of semantic information is rendered unlikely.
9862924	16	n = 16	Temporal and intensity coding of pain in human cortex. J. Neurophysiol. 80:3312-3320, 1998. We used a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique in healthy right-handed volunteers to demonstrate cortical areas displaying changes of activity significantly related to the time profile of the perceived intensity of experimental somatic pain over the course of several minutes. Twenty-four subjects (ascorbic acid group) received a subcutaneous injection of a dilute ascorbic acid solution into the dorsum of one  foot, inducing prolonged burning pain (peak pain intensity on a 0-100 scale: 48 +/- 3, mean +/- SE; duration: 11.9 +/- 0.8 min). fMRI data sets were continuously acquired for approximately 20 min, beginning 5 min before and lasting 15 min after the onset of stimulation, from two sagittal planes on the medial hemispheric wall contralateral to the stimulated site, including the cingulate cortex and the putative foot representation area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Neural clusters whose fMRI signal time courses were positively or negatively correlated (P < 0.0005) with the individual pain intensity curve were  identified by cross-correlation statistics in all 24 volunteers. The spatial extent of the identified clusters was linearly related (P < 0.0001) to peak pain  intensity. Regional analyses showed that positively correlated clusters were present in the majority of subjects in SI, cingulate, motor, and premotor cortex. Negative correlations were found predominantly in medial parietal, perigenual cingulate, and medial prefrontal regions. To test whether these neural changes were due to aspecific arousal or emotional reactions, related either to anticipation or presence of pain, fMRI experiments were performed with the same protocol in two additional groups of volunteers, subjected either to subcutaneous saline injection (saline: n = 16), inducing mild short-lasting pain (peak pain intensity 23 +/- 4; duration 2.8 +/- 0.6 min) or to nonnoxious mechanical stimulation of the skin (controls: n = 16) at the same body site. Subjects did not know in advance which stimulus would occur. The spatial extent of neural clusters whose signal time courses were positively or negatively correlated with  the mean pain intensity curve of subjects injected with ascorbic acid was significantly larger (P < 0.001) in the ascorbic acid group than both saline and  controls, suggesting that the observed responses were specifically related to pain intensity and duration. These findings reveal distributed cortical systems,  including parietal areas as well as cingulate and frontal regions, involved in dynamic encoding of pain intensity over time, a process of great biological and clinical relevance.

11553288	8	n = 8	Dexterous manipulation of delicate objects requires exquisite control of fingertip forces. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify  brain regions involved in the skillful scaling of these forces when normal human  subjects (n = 8) held with precision grip a small object (weight 200 g) in the dominant right hand. In one condition, they used their normal, automatically scaled grip force. The object was held gently in a second condition; the isometric grip force was maintained just above the critical level at which the object would have slipped. In a third condition, the force was increased to hold  the object with a more firm grip. The supplementary and cingulate motor areas were significantly more active during the gentle force condition than during either of the other conditions in all subjects, despite weaker contractions of the hand muscles. In addition, the left primary sensorimotor cortex, the ventral  premotor cortex and the left posterior parietal cortex were more strongly activated during gentle than during normal grasping. These novel results suggest  that these regions are specifically involved in dexterous scaling of fingertip forces during object manipulation.
11796770	6	n = 6	OBJECTIVES: Functional reorganisation of the motor or sensory cortex has been demonstrated in animals after section of mixed peripheral nerves. Here functional changes in the motor cortex specifically after peripheral motor denervation in humans are investigated. METHODS: Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to study brain activation during a finger flexion-extension task in patients with a late onset,  acquired pure motor neuropathy (n=6), contrasting results with those from patients with pure sensory neuropathies (n=4) or healthy controls (n=7). RESULTS: Increases in the extent of activation in the motor cortex both ipsilateral and contralateral to the hand moved were found in the patients with motor neuropathy. The neuroanatomical localisation of the mixed contralateral sensorimotor cortex activation volume was more posterior for the patients with motor neuropathy than  for the healthy controls (mean difference, 12 mm, p<0.05). The pure sensory neuropathy group by contrast showed no change in the extent of activation relative to healthy controls and a trend for more anterior primary sensorimotor cortex activation (p<0.06). To test whether the increased activation volumes found in patients with motor neuropathy were a result simply of factors such as increased effort with movement rather than the motor denervation, patients with hand weakness from inclusion body myositis (n=4) were studied while making similar hand movements. No differences in either the numbers of significantly activated voxels or in their localisation were found relative to healthy controls (n=10). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a novel demonstration that peripheral  denervation (as distinguished from factors related to weakness) leads to functional reorganisation of the sensorimotor cortex in the adult brain. This suggests that adaptive responses to motor denervation involve the central as well as the peripheral nervous system.

11822992	13	n = 13	BACKGROUND: Structural deficiencies within limbic and prefrontal regions may contribute to the characteristic drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors that prevail in persons dependent on cocaine. To date, a focal structural analysis of  the brains of cocaine patients has not been undertaken. METHODS: We used voxel based morphometry in conjunction with statistical parametric mapping on the structural magnetic resonance images of cocaine-dependent (n = 13) and cocaine-naive individuals (n = 16) to assess differences between the two groups in gray and white matter concentration. RESULTS: We report a decrease in gray matter concentration in the ventromedial orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, anteroventral insular, and superior temporal cortices of cocaine patients in comparison to controls (p <.01 corrected for multiple comparisons). The average percentage decrease in gray matter concentration within a region ranged from 5% to 11%. White matter concentration did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the brains of cocaine patients are structurally dissimilar from those of nondrug-using controls. The differences were detected in regions involved in decision-making, behavioral inhibition and assignation of emotional valence to environmental stimuli and, hence, may contribute to some of the behavioral deficits characteristic of chronic cocaine users.

11904454	14	n = 14	We used functional MRI to test the hypothesis that emotional states can selectively influence cognition-related neural activity in lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), as evidence for an integration of emotion and cognition. Participants (n = 14) watched short videos intended to induce emotional states (pleasant/approach related, unpleasant/withdrawal related, or neutral). After each video, the participants were scanned while performing a 3-back working memory task having either words or faces as stimuli. Task-related neural activity in bilateral PFC showed a predicted pattern: an Emotion x Stimulus crossover interaction, with no main effects, with activity predicting task performance. This highly specific result indicates that emotion and higher cognition can be truly integrated, i.e., at some point of processing, functional specialization is lost, and emotion and cognition conjointly and equally contribute to the control  of thought and behavior. Other regions in lateral PFC showed hemispheric specialization for emotion and for stimuli separately, consistent with a hierarchical and hemisphere-based mechanism of integration.
12067697	5	n = 5	Brain areas associated with both nondeclarative categorization and recognition memory were identified and contrasted using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of healthy volunteers. Activity during dot-pattern categorization and recognition were compared with a control task (counting dots) in two separate groups of participants (n=5 each). The network of areas associated with nondeclarative categorization was found to include bilateral inferior prefrontal  and parietal cortical areas that have been implicated in several other studies of categorization. During recognition, increased activity was found in posterior visual areas, the precuneus, posterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortex. Using the common control condition as a reference, recognition and categorization were contrasted and recognition was found to evoke more activity in posterior early visual cortex, the precuneus, right medial temporal lobe and right dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. Previous research has implicated changes in visual representation in learning a category of dot-pattern by comparing activity evoked by categorical and non-categorical stimuli. The current findings support those results and additionally identify brain areas active during categorization  that are involved in expressing this category knowledge.
12165364	17	n = 17	The aims of this study were to: (1) assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on brain activity in depressed patients as measured by single photon emission tomography (SPECT); (2) evaluate the predictive value of brain SPECT on the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS. Patients (n=17) received 1600 rTMS stimuli at a rate of 10 Hz, 5 days per week for 2 weeks to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Whole brain SPECT data were acquired using Tc99m-Bicisate. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was correlated with the % change in the 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score (Delta-HDRS) and a semiquantitative region of interest (ROI) analysis was conducted. Prior to rTMS there was a significant left-right asymmetry favoring the right, whereas 2 weeks  after the rTMS treatment this asymmetry was reversed. The rCBF in limbic structures was negatively correlated with the outcome and rCBF in several neocortical areas was positively correlated. Brain SPECT can provide information  about mechanisms of action of rTMS and may have predictive value for the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS.
12244080	4	n = 4	Reorganization after early brain injuries is not only determined by the maturational stage of the CNS at the time of the insult (timing), but also by the structural properties, location and extent of the lesion. This study addresses the impact of different lesion extents on the type of reorganization induced in a cohort of patients with lesions of uniform structure and location (unilateral periventricular defects) and similar timing (early third trimester of pregnancy). Twelve young adult patients with congenital hemiparesis and 10 age-matched controls were studied. The severity of structural damage to hand motor projections of the cortico-spinal tract was assessed on semi-coronal MRI reconstructions along anatomical landmarks of cortico-spinal tract somatotopy. The functional integrity of these crossed cortico-spinal projections in the affected hemisphere, as well as the presence of any abnormal ipsilateral projections to the paretic hand, was examined by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Cortical activation during simple voluntary hand movements was studied by functional MRI (fMRI). Patients with small lesions (SL; n = 4) and only mild hand motor impairment possessed intact crossed cortico-spinal projections to the paretic hand, whereas no motor response could be elicited by TMS of the affected hemisphere in those with large lesions (LL; n = 6) and more severe hand motor impairment. Evidence for compensatory recruitment of the unaffected hemisphere was found in both subgroups. In the SL group, fMRI demonstrated ipsilateral activation of premotor areas, without any abnormal projections to the paretic hand originating from these sites. In the LL group, such abnormal ipsilateral projections to the paretic hand were indeed found, and  fMRI confirmed cortical activation of an abnormal ipsilateral hand motor representation in the primary sensorimotor region of the unaffected hemisphere. Two patients with intermediate-sized lesions presented combined features of both  groups (SL, LL). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the type of cortico-spinal reorganization depends on the extent of the brain lesion. We propose that involvement of the ipsilateral hemisphere can be (i) of the premotor type, i.e. without ipsilateral motor projections but with significant activation  of ipsilateral premotor areas, or (ii) of the primary motor type, i.e. with abnormal ipsilateral cortico-spinal projections to the paretic hand.

12477698	20	n = 20	The aim of the present study was to compare eyeblink conditioning in cerebellar patients with lesions including the territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) and in patients with lesions restricted to the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The cerebellar areas known to be most critical in eyeblink conditioning based on animal data (i.e. Larsell lobule H VI and interposed nucleus) are commonly supplied by the SCA. Eyeblink conditioning was expected to be impaired in SCA, but not in PICA patients. A total of 27 cerebellar patients and 25 age-matched controls were tested. Cerebellar lesions were primarily unilateral (n = 20). Most patients suffered from ischaemic infarctions of the SCA (n = 11) or the PICA (n = 13). The other patients presented with cerebellar tumours (n = 2) and cerebellar agenesis (n = 1). The extent of the cortical lesion (i.e. which lobuli were affected) and possible involvement of the cerebellar nuclei was determined by 3D-MRI. As expected, the ability to acquire classically conditioned eyeblink responses was significantly reduced in the group of all cerebellar patients compared with the controls. In the patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions, conditioning deficits were present ipsilaterally. In SCA patients with lesions including hemispheral lobules VI and Crus I, eyeblink conditioning was significantly reduced on the affected side compared with the unaffected side. No significant difference between the affected and unaffected sides was present in patients with lesions restricted to  the common PICA territory (i.e. Crus II and below). Conditioning deficits were neither significantly different in SCA patients with pure cortical lesions compared with SCA patients with additional nuclear impairment nor in SCA patients with unilateral lesions compared with SCA patients with bilateral lesions. To summarize, unilateral cortical lesions of the superior cerebellum appear to be sufficient to reduce eyeblink conditioning in humans significantly.

12559652	10	n = 10	BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to examine the neuronal circuitry underlying different emotional states (neutral, sad, anxious, and traumatic) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in traumatized subjects versus traumatized subjects without PTSD. METHODS: Traumatized subjects with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) PTSD were studied using the script-driven symptom provocation paradigm adapted to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at a 4 Tesla field strength. RESULTS: Compared to the trauma-exposed comparison group, PTSD subjects showed significantly less activation of the thalamus and the anterior cingulate gyrus (area 32) in all three emotional states (sad, anxious, and traumatic). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest thalamic and anterior cingulate dysfunction in the recollection of traumatic as well as other negative events. Thalamic and anterior cingulate dysfunction may underlie emotion dysregulation often observed  clinically in PTSD.

12595193	12	n = 12	Questions pertaining to the neurobiological effects of psychotherapy are now considered among the most topical in psychiatry. With respect to this issue, positron emission tomography (PET) findings indicate that cognitive and behavioral modifications, occurring in a psychotherapeutic context, can lead to regional brain metabolic changes in patients with major depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, which constitutes the first neuroimaging investigation of the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) using an emotional activation paradigm, was to probe the effects of CBT on the neural correlates of spider phobia. In order to do so, fMRI was used in subjects suffering from spider phobia (n = 12) to measure, before and after effective CBT, regional brain activity during the viewing of film excerpts depicting spiders. Normal control subjects were also scanned (once) while they were exposed to the same film excerpts. Results showed that, in phobic subjects before CBT, the transient state of fear triggered, during the viewing of the phobogenic stimuli,  was correlated with significant activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area-BA 10), the parahippocampal gyrus, and the visual associative cortical areas, bilaterally. For normal control subjects (n = 13), only the left middle occipital gyrus and the right inferior temporal gyrus were significantly activated. In phobic subjects before CBT, the activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) may reflect the use of metacognitive strategies aimed at self-regulating the fear triggered by the spider film excerpts, whereas the parahippocampal activation might be related to an automatic reactivation of the contextual fear memory that led to the development of avoidance behavior and the maintenance of spider phobia. After successful completion of CBT, no significant activation was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) or the parahippocampal gyrus. These findings suggest that a psychotherapeutic approach, such as CBT, has the potential to modify the dysfunctional neural circuitry associated with anxiety disorders. They further indicate that the changes made at the mind level, within a psychotherapeutic context, are able to functionally "rewire" the brain.

12657700	17	n = 17	If attention is divided during learning, memory suffers. Nevertheless, individuals can learn information with divided attention. This event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (n = 17) investigated what neural processes support (1) learning with divided attention and (2) retrieval of information learned with divided attention. Participants encoded words (Is the word abstract or concrete?) while performing an auditory discrimination task (press a button whenever an auditory pattern changes). The auditory task was easy or hard, depending on the similarity of the patterns. A behavioral study indicated that detailed ("recollective") information was more likely to be present for words encoded with the easy versus the hard concurrent task. Words encoded with the hard versus the easy concurrent task, in contrast, were more likely to rely on less detailed ("familiarity"-based) information. fMRI revealed  encoding-related activation in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and left hippocampus that was linked to successful memory formation only for items encoded with the easy task. In contrast, activation in the right PFC and left parahippocampal gyrus was linked to successful memory for all items. Thus, successful encoding with the hard concurrent task was supported by a subset of the regions recruited for successful encoding with the easy task. The neural processes recruited for successful retrieval also depended on the encoding condition: The left PFC was disproportionately recruited for retrieval of items encoded with the easy task, whereas the right PFC was disproportionately recruited for retrieval of items encoded with the hard task. These findings may reflect left-sided specialization for recollective memories and right-sided specialization for familiarity-based traces.
12738340	13	n = 13	Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare cortical activation patterns in healthy volunteers with those in patients with schizophrenia during a modified verbal Stroop task. Healthy subjects (n=13) and patients with schizophrenia (n=13) on stable antipsychotic treatment, matched on demographic variables, were included. Patients were preselected on the basis of good performance on a selective attention test. Patients with schizophrenia showed a significantly increased pattern of activation in the left and right inferior frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. A significant negative correlation between activation of the left prefrontal cortex and accuracy in the  modified Stroop test was observed for healthy controls but not schizophrenia patients. Although both groups recruited the prefrontal cortex during the modified Stroop task, for the schizophrenia patients this activation was bilateral, whereas for the controls this activation was primarily in the left hemisphere, suggesting that patients with schizophrenia recruited more prefrontal regions to perform the task with the same accuracy as healthy controls. Our findings of increased activity across multiple areas of the brain, including dorsolateral frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, in patients with schizophrenia who perform relatively well on a task of selective attention give further evidence that task performance may be a confounding factor in the interpretation of neuroimaging results.

12814585	10	n = 10	Several functional neuroimaging studies have been carried out in healthy subjects to investigate the neural correlates of sadness. Importantly, there is little consistency among the results of these studies. Hypothesizing that individual differences may account for the discrepancies among these investigations, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to identify the neural circuitry underlying this basic emotion. In these two methodologically identical studies, two different groups (n = 10 for each study) of healthy female subjects were scanned while they were experiencing a transient state of sadness induced by viewing sad film excerpts. In the first of these studies, sadness was  correlated with significant loci of activation in the anterior temporal pole and  insula (P < 0.05, corrected). In the second study, however, sadness was correlated with significant activation in the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices (P < 0.05, corrected). In addition, individual statistical parametric maps revealed a marked degree of interindividual variability in both Study 1 and  Study 2. These results strongly support the view that individual differences may  be responsible for the inconsistencies found in the literature regarding the neural substrates of sadness and of other basic emotions. These findings also suggest that individual data should be reported in addition to group data, because they provide useful information about the variability present in the subjects investigated and, thus, about the typicality and generalizability of the results.
12814589	6	n = 6	Whereas converging lines of evidence suggest that anesthetic-induced unconsciousness may result from disruption of functional interactions within neural networks involving the thalamus and cerebral cortex, the effects anesthetics have on human thalamocortical connectivity remain unexamined with current neuroimaging techniques. To address this issue we retrospectively analyzed positron emission tomography data from 11 volunteers scanned for regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCMRglu) when awake and again during isoflurane- (n = 6) or halothane- (n = 5) induced unconsciousness using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) and structural equation modeling. A main effect analysis, contrasting awake and unconscious metabolic activity, localized  a discrete region of the left va/vl thalamus whose relative rCMRglu activity was  significantly suppressed (P < 0.05, corrected) during the unconscious state. To identify brain regions whose functional connectivity with this region of the thalamus was impaired during the unconscious state, a psychophysiological interaction analysis was performed. This analysis revealed effects predominantly  in topographically related areas of the primary motor and supplementary motor association cortices. Structural equation modeling of a neuroanatomical network encompassing these empirically identified regions revealed significant state-related changes in effective connectivity (chi(2)diff (6)-15.88; P < 0.05)  which primarily involved impairment of thalamocortical and corticocortical projections during the unconscious state. These findings support the hypothesis that a mechanistic component underlying general-anesthetic-induced unconsciousness involves disruption of functional interactions within thalamocortical neural networks.

12880821	12	n = 12	Single subject and group analyses (n = 12) showed that the eyes-open and eyes-closed states in complete darkness considerably and consistently differ in the patterns of associated brain activation in fMRI. During nonchanging external  stimulation, ocular motor and attentional systems were activated when the eyes were open; the visual, somatosensory, vestibular, and auditory systems were activated when the eyes were closed. These data suggest that there are two different states of mental activity: with the eyes closed, an "interoceptive" state characterized by imagination and multisensory activity and with the eyes open, an "exteroceptive" state characterized by attention and ocular motor activity. Our study also shows that the chosen baseline condition may have a considerable impact on activation patterns and on the interpretation of brain activation studies.
14689505	12	n = 12	Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to examine the neural correlates of depth of processing during encoding and retrieval of photographs in older normal volunteers (n = 12). Separate scans were run during deep (natural vs. man-made decision) and shallow (color vs. black-and-white decision) encoding and during old/new recognition of pictures initially presented in one of the two encoding conditions. A baseline condition consisting of a scrambled, color photograph was  used as a contrast in each scan. Recognition accuracy was greater for the pictures on which semantic decisions were made at encoding, consistent with the expected levels of processing effect. A mixed-effects model was used to compare fMRI differences between conditions (deep-baseline vs. shallow-baseline) in both  encoding and retrieval. For encoding, this contrast revealed greater activation associated with deep encoding in several areas, including the left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), left middle temporal gyrus, and left anterior thalamus. Increased left hippocampal, right dorsolateral, and inferior frontal activations were found for recognition of items that had been presented in the deep relative to the shallow encoding condition. We speculate that the modulation of activity in these regions by the depth of processing manipulation shows that these regions support effective encoding and successful retrieval. A direct comparison between encoding and retrieval revealed greater activation during retrieval in the medial temporal (right hippocampus and bilateral PHG), anterior  cingulate, and bilateral prefrontal (inferior and dorsolateral). Most notably, greater right posterior PHG was found during encoding compared to recognition. Focusing on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) region, our results suggest a greater  involvement of both anterior MTL and prefrontal regions in retrieval compared to  encoding.
14732592	17	n = 17	BACKGROUND: Findings from postmortem studies suggest reduced prefrontal cortical  thickness in schizophrenia; however, cortical thickness in first-episode schizophrenia has not been evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Prefrontal cortical thickness was measured using MRI in first-episode schizophrenia patients (n = 17), first-episode affective psychosis patients (n =  17), and normal control subjects (n = 17); subjects were age-matched within 2 years and within a narrow age range (18-29 years). A previous study using the same subjects reported reduced prefrontal gray matter volume in first-episode schizophrenia. Manual editing was performed on those prefrontal segmentations before cortical thickness was measured. RESULTS: Prefrontal cortical thickness was not significantly different among groups. Prefrontal gray matter volume and thickness were, however, positively correlated in both schizophrenia and control  subjects. The product of boundary complexity and thickness, an alternative measure of volume, was positively correlated with volume for all three groups. Finally, age and age at first medication were negatively correlated with prefrontal cortical thickness only in first-episode schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of MRI for the study of cortical thickness abnormalities in schizophrenia. Correlations between cortical thickness and age and between cortical thickness and age at first medication suggest that the longer the schizophrenic process has been operative, the thinner the prefrontal cortex, although this needs confirmation in a longitudinal study.

14749289	69	n = 69	Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder that typically develops in early adult life. Structural imaging studies have indicated that patients with the illness, and to some extent their unaffected relatives, have subtle deficits in several brain regions, including prefrontal and temporal lobes. It is, however, not known how this inherited vulnerability leads to psychosis. This study used a  covert verbal initiation fMRI task previously shown to elicit frontal and temporal activity (the Hayling sentence completion task) to examine this issue. A large (n = 69) number of young participants at high risk of developing schizophrenia for genetic reasons took part, together with a matched group of healthy controls (n = 21). At the time of investigation, none had any psychotic disorder, but on detailed interview some of the high-risk participants (n = 27) reported isolated psychotic symptoms. The study aimed to determine: (i) whether there were activation differences that occurred in all subjects with a genetic risk of schizophrenia (i.e. 'trait' effects); and (ii) whether there were activation differences that only occurred in those at high risk who had isolated  psychotic symptoms ('state' effects). No activation differences were found in regions commonly reported to be abnormal in the established illness, namely the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or in the temporal lobes, but group differences of apparent genetic cause were evident in medial prefrontal, thalamic and cerebellar regions. In addition, differences in activation in those with symptoms were found in the intraparietal sulcus. No significant differences in performance were found between the groups, and all subjects were antipsychotic naive. These findings therefore suggest that vulnerability to schizophrenia may be inherited as a disruption in a fronto-thalamic-cerebellar network, and the earliest changes specific to the psychotic state may be related to hyperactivation in the parietal lobe.

14980558	12	n = 12	While a detailed understanding of brain activity with hand movements has developed, less is known about the functional anatomy of motor control for foot movements. Here we have used fMRI to define brain activity associated with unilateral foot extension and flexion, component movements of gait. We studied brain responses to visually cued active and passive movements and periods of either preparation (before active movement) or anticipation (before passive movement) with a pseudo-randomized block design. A mixed-effects (n = 12) contrast of the active movement condition vs. rest identified brain activation in regions including the medial wall of the primary sensorimotor cortex, consistent  with expected somatotopy. Medial wall activation during passive movement vs. rest was less intense and localized to the same region. Frontal and association cortices were more active during preparation or anticipation periods than during  the movements themselves. A contrast of preparation to move vs. active movement showed significant activation in the medial frontal and frontopolar gyri and the  precuneus. Contrast of the anticipation of movement with the passive movement condition revealed activation in the dorsal premotor cortex and precuneus. Our study thus provides evidence for somatotopy in multiple functional regions in the motor control network. The anterior prefrontal activity is involved in the preparation for cued movement with distinct regions of the medial motor cortex (including SMA and CMA) preferentially involved in motor program planning and execution. This direct characterization of brain activation patterns associated with foot movements promises use of fMRI for the functional analysis of pathologies of gait.
14980562	15	n = 15	Empathy requires the ability to map the feelings of others onto our own nervous system. Until recently, there was no plausible mechanism to explain how such a mapping might occur. The discovery of mirror neurons, however, suggests that the  nervous system is capable of mapping the observed actions of others onto the premotor cortex of the self, at least for reaching and grasping movements. Is there a mirroring system for emotive actions, such as facial expression? Subjects (N = 15; all right-handed; eight men, seven women) watched movies of facial expressions (smile or frown) and hand movements (move index or middle finger) while brain activity was imaged using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects watched the movies under three different conditions: passive viewing, active imitation, and an active motor control. Subjects also performed a verb generation task to functionally identify language-processing areas. We found evidence for a common cortical imitation circuit for both face and hand imitation, consisting of Broca's area, bilateral dorsal and ventral premotor areas, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), supplementary motor area, posterior temporo-occipital cortex, and cerebellar areas. For faces, passive viewing led to significant activation in the right ventral premotor area, whereas imitation produced bilateral activation. This result is consistent with evidence for right  hemisphere (RH) dominance for emotional processing, and suggests that there may be a right hemisphere mirroring system that could provide a neural substrate for  empathy.
15003765	9	n = 9	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine cerebellar areas related to conditioning of the nociceptive leg withdrawal reflex using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Because of the aversive nature of the unconditioned stimulus effects of accompanying fear conditioning were expected. METHODS: In 20 healthy adult subjects leg withdrawal reflex conditioning was performed using a standard delay protocol during MR-scanning. Electromyographic recordings from the anterior tibial and biceps femoris muscles  were used to quantify conditioned responses. Fear-related changes of heart rate were assessed. RESULTS: In the group of all subjects a significant increase of cerebellar activation was found in the anterior and posterior vermis. In the group of subjects (n=9) who showed conditioned leg withdrawal responses cerebellar activation was more pronounced in parts of the anterior vermis, which  correspond to the known leg representation. In the group of subjects (n=11) who did not develop conditioned responses cerebellar activation was more pronounced in the posterolateral hemispheres. Changes of heart rate, however, did not significantly differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that areas within the anterior vermis are involved in conditioning of the leg withdrawal response. The present results, however, do not allow to differentiate between motor performance, learning or timing-related processes. Areas in the posterior vermis and cerebellar hemispheres may be related to concomitant fear conditioning. SIGNIFICANCE: Results of the present event-related fMRI study suggest involvement of the human cerebellum in conditioning of the nociceptive leg withdrawal response.

15110735	6	n = 6	BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists and antagonists can reduce abnormal movements and vocalizations (tics) in Tourette syndrome (TS); however, dopamine-responsive abnormal function in specific brain regions has not been directly demonstrated in TS. We sought to identify dopamine-modulated brain regions that function abnormally in TS by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a working memory (WM) task, and infusion of the dopamine prodrug levodopa (while blocking dopamine production outside the brain). METHODS: We obtained complete fMRI data in 8 neuroleptic-naive adults with a chronic tic disorder and in 10 well-matched tic-free control subjects. RESULTS: Different task-sensitive brain regions responded differently to the WM task depending on levodopa status and diagnostic group (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p <.001). Four regions showed interactions with diagnosis (ANOVA, p <.001). In TS subjects, the task induced excessive brain activity in parietal cortex, medial frontal gyrus, and thalamus.  Levodopa normalized the excess activity. In left parietal cortex, the degree of normalization was greater in patients with higher levodopa plasma concentrations  (n = 6; Spearman's r = -.84, p =.04) and a greater degree of diagnostic confidence of TS (r = -.71, p =.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with a dopamine-influenced functional abnormality of brain response in TS and suggest testable hypotheses about the mechanism by which dopamine antagonists and agonists alleviate tics.
15115734	44	n = 44	Three previous studies using the GO/NOGO task were examined to characterize the pattern of functional activation seen during error-related processing. The large  sample size (n = 44) also allowed investigation of the influence of individual differences in age, sex, self-reported absentmindedness and reaction speed on the level of activation. Errors were seen to activate a network of regions including  the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), bilateral insula, thalamus and right inferior parietal lobule. Split-half comparisons performed for each of the individual difference variables indicated greater ACC and pre-SMA activation for older subjects while slower responders showed greater activation in the parietal, lateral PFC, insula and ACC regions. Whereas males and females demonstrated equivalent levels of activation in both the ACC and insula, self-reported absentmindedness related to reduced activation  in these regions. Our review of the current imaging literature on error-related activation indicates that, despite the use of a variety of other cognitive paradigms, the network of regions identified here is consistent with these previous studies, suggesting that these regions are critical to a 'general' error-related response. Furthermore, this response is, in part, influenced by individual differences in both demographic characteristics and behavioural performance.
15145996	14	n = 14	BACKGROUND: The cerebellum is of potential interest for understanding adaptive responses in motor control in patients with multiple sclerosis because of the high intrinsic synaptic plasticity of this brain region. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative roles of interactions between the neocortex and the cerebellum using measures of functional connectivity. METHODS: A role for altered neocortical-cerebellar functional connectivity in adaptive responses to injury from multiple sclerosis was tested using 1.5 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during figure writing with the dominant right hand in patients with predominantly early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: Patients (n = 14) showed a more bihemispheric pattern of activation in motor cortex than healthy controls (n = 11). Correlations between task related signal changes in neocortical and cerebellar regions of interest were used as a measure  of functional connectivity. Healthy controls showed strong functional connectivity between the left motor cortex and the right cerebellar dentate nucleus. Significant connectivity between the left primary motor cortex and the right dentate was not found in patients. However, patients had significant connectivity between the left premotor neocortex and the ipsilateral (left) cerebellar cortex (crus I), which was not found in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in apparent cerebellar-neocortical functional connectivity may mediate potentially adaptive changes in brain motor control in patients with multiple sclerosis. Similar changes in the cerebellum and premotor cortex have been reported in the healthy brain during motor learning, suggesting that common mechanisms may contribute to normal motor learning and motor recovery after injury from multiple sclerosis.

15158422	17	n = 17	BACKGROUND: Females appear to be more sensitive and responsive to social cues, including threat signals, than are males. Recent theoretical models suggest that  developmental changes in brain functioning play important roles in the emergence  of such gender differences. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine developmental and gender differences in activation of neural structures thought to mediate attention to emotional faces depicting varying degrees of threat. Analyses focused on the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex during the evaluation of threat conveyed by faces. Healthy adolescents (n = 17; 53% male) and adults (n = 17; 53% male) were scanned while they rated how threatening pictures of neutral and emotional (angry, fearful, or happy) faces appeared. RESULTS: Results indicate significant interactions among age, gender, and face type for activation during explicit threat monitoring. In particular, adult women activated orbitofrontal cortex and  amygdala selectively to unambiguous threat (angry) cues, while adult men showed a less discriminating pattern of activation. No gender differences were evident for adolescents, who as a group resembled adult males. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there are gender differences in patterns of neural responses to emotional faces that are not fully apparent until adulthood.

15246452	8	n = 8	The aim of this study was to investigate pathophysiological changes at an early stage of clinical Huntington's disease (HD) using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study and a serial reaction time task paradigm. Mildly affected and presymptomatic HD subjects (n = 8) and healthy normal controls (NC, n = 12) were studied. A group behavioral effect of implicit learning was seen only in the control population. Individual statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis showed more consistent activation of the caudate nucleus and putamen in the NC group. In the HD group, the group average SPM showed significant activation in the right head of caudate nucleus, as well as bilateral thalami, left middle temporal, right superior temporal, right superior frontal, right middle and inferior frontal and right postcentral gyri. In the comparison of between-group differences (NC-HD), reduced activation in the HD group relative to NC was observed in the right middle frontal, left middle occipital, left precuneus, and  left middle frontal gyri. The variable striatal activity in the Huntington's group suggests early functional loss possibly associated with previously demonstrated early atrophy of these same neural structures.

15275902	8	n = 8	Human swallowing represents a complex highly coordinated sensorimotor function whose functional neuroanatomy remains incompletely understood. Specifically, previous studies have failed to delineate the temporo-spatial sequence of those cerebral loci active during the differing phases of swallowing. We therefore sought to define the temporal characteristics of cortical activity associated with human swallowing behaviour using a novel application of magnetoencephalography (MEG). In healthy volunteers (n = 8, aged 28-45), 151-channel whole cortex MEG was recorded during the conditions of oral water infusion, volitional wet swallowing (5 ml bolus), tongue thrust or rest. Each condition lasted for 5 s and was repeated 20 times. Synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) analysis was performed on each active epoch and compared to rest. Temporal sequencing of brain activations utilised time-frequency wavelet plots of regions selected using virtual electrodes. Following SAM analysis, water infusion preferentially activated the caudolateral sensorimotor cortex, whereas during volitional swallowing and tongue movement, the superior sensorimotor cortex was more strongly active. Time-frequency wavelet analysis indicated that sensory input from the tongue simultaneously activated caudolateral sensorimotor  and primary gustatory cortex, which appeared to prime the superior sensory and motor cortical areas, involved in the volitional phase of swallowing. Our data support the existence of a temporal synchrony across the whole cortical swallowing network, with sensory input from the tongue being critical. Thus, the  ability to non-invasively image this network, with intra-individual and high temporal resolution, provides new insights into the brain processing of human swallowing.
15295012	22	n = 22	Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed human brain regions, notably in the fusiform gyrus, that respond selectively to images of faces as opposed to other kinds of objects. Here we use fMRI to show that the mid-fusiform gyrus responds with nearly the same level of selectivity to images of human bodies without faces, relative to tools and scenes. In a group-average analysis (n = 22), the fusiform activations identified by contrasting faces versus tools and bodies versus tools are very similar. Analyses of within-subjects regions of interest, however, show that the peaks of the two activations occupy close but distinct locations. In a second experiment, we find that the body-selective fusiform region, but not the face-selective region, responds more to stick figure depictions of bodies than to scrambled controls. This result further distinguishes the two foci and confirms that the body-selective response generalizes to abstract image formats. These results challenge accounts of the mid-fusiform gyrus that focus solely on faces and suggest that this region contains multiple distinct category-selective neural representations.
15325390	47	n = 47	Total brain volume accounts for about 16% of the variance in general intelligence scores (IQ), but how volumes of specific regions-of-interest (ROIs) relate to IQ  is not known. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in two independent samples to identify substantial gray matter (GM) correlates of IQ. Based on statistical conjunction of both samples (N = 47; P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons), more gray matter is associated with higher IQ in discrete Brodmann  areas (BA) including frontal (BA 10, 46, 9), temporal (BA 21, 37, 22, 42), parietal (BA 43 and 3), and occipital (BA 19) lobes and near BA 39 for white matter (WM). These results underscore the distributed neural basis of intelligence and suggest a developmental course for volume--IQ relationships in adulthood.
15381748	15	n = 15	Learning a motor skill is associated with changes in patterns of brain activation with movement. Here we have further characterized these dynamics during fast (short-term) learning of a visuomotor skill using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects (n = 15) were studied as they learned to visually track a moving target by varying the isometric force applied to a pressure plate held in  the right hand. Learning was confirmed by demonstration of improved performance and automaticity (the relative lack of need for conscious attention during task execution). We identified two distinct, time-dependent patterns of functional changes in the brain associated with these behavioral changes. An initial, more attentionally demanding stage of learning was associated with the greatest relative activity in widely distributed, predominantly cortical regions including prefrontal, bilateral sensorimotor, and parietal cortices. The caudate nucleus and ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere also showed significant activity. Over time, as performance improved, activity in these regions progressively decreased. There was an increase in activity in subcortical motor regions including that of  the cerebellar dentate and the thalamus and putamen. Short-term motor-skill learning thus is associated with a progressive reduction of widely distributed activations in cortical regions responsible for executive functions, processing somatosensory feedback and motor planning. The results suggest that early performance gains rely strongly on prefrontal-caudate interactions with later increased activity in a subcortical circuit involving the cerebellum and basal ganglia as the task becomes more automatic. Characterization of these changes provides a potential tool for functional "dissection" of pathologies of movement  and motor learning.
15543553	9	n = 9	We sought to determine the influence of tissue damage and the potential impact of cortical reorganization on the performance to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition  Test (PASAT) in patients at the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis (MS). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using PASAT as paradigm were carried out in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS) compared to  18 controls. MTR histogram analyses showed structural abnormalities in patients involving the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) but also the gray matter (GM). Mean PASAT scores were significantly lower in the group of patients taken as a whole, and were correlated with the mean NAWM MTR value. No correlation was observed between PASAT scores and GM MTR. However, in the subgroup of patients with normal PASAT performance (n = 9), fMRI showed larger activations in bilateral Brodmann area 45 (BA45) and right BA44 compared to that in controls (n  = 18). In these areas with potentially compensatory reorganization, the whole group of patients (n = 18) showed significantly greater activation than controls  (n = 18). Activation in the right BA45 was inversely correlated with the mean NAWM MTR and the peak position of GM MTR histograms of patients. This study indicates that even at the earliest stage of MS, cortical reorganization is present inside the executive system of working memory and could tend to limit the determinant functional impact of NAWM injury on the execution of the PASAT.

15734344	28	n = 28	Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is prescribed in females only, but its use in male subjects is increasingly considered. With a  growing number of patients having potential benefit from raloxifene, the need for an assessment of its effects on brain function is growing. Effects of estrogens on brain function are very subtle and difficult to detect by neuropsychological assessment. Functional imaging techniques, however, have been relatively successful in detecting such changes. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine effects of raloxifene treatment on memory function. Healthy elderly males (n = 28; mean age 63.6 years, SD 2.4) were scanned during performance on a face encoding paradigm. Scans were made at baseline and after 3 months of treatment with either raloxifene (n = 14) or placebo (n = 14). Treatment effects were analyzed using mixed-effects statistical analysis (FSL). Activation during task performance involved bilateral parietal and prefrontal areas, anterior cingulate gyrus, and inferior prefrontal, occipital, and mediotemporal areas bilaterally. When compared to placebo, raloxifene treatment significantly enhanced activation in these structures (Z > 3.1), except for mediotemporal areas. Task performance accuracy diminished in the placebo group (P = 0.02), but remained constant in the raloxifene group (P = 0.60). In conclusion, raloxifene treatment enhanced brain activation in areas spanning a number of different cognitive domains, suggesting an effect on cortical arousal. Such effects may translate into small effects on behavior, including effects on attention and working memory performance, executive functions, verbal skills, and episodic memory. Further neuropsychological assessment is necessary to test the validity of these predictions.

15734349	15	n = 15	Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an attractive alternative to BOLD fMRI. Nevertheless, current ASL fMRI  techniques are limited by several factors that hamper more routine applications in humans. One of these factors is restricted brain coverage so that whole-brain  ASL fMRI studies have never been reported. The present study tested the ability of a multislice continuous ASL (CASL) fMRI approach using a small surface coil placed on the subject's neck to map changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) throughout the brain while healthy individuals (N = 15) performed memory-guided sequential finger movements at a mean rate of approximately 0.5 Hz. As predicted by results from a large number of studies, reliable task-related increases in flow were detected across subjects not only in primary and associative cortical areas but also in subcortical brain regions. When normalized to baseline, rCBF increased 31% in the hand representation area (HRA) of left primary motor cortex (M1), 13% in the left supplementary motor area proper (SMA), 10% in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 10-18% in the bilateral intraparietal sulci, 6% in the HRA of left putamen, 10% in the left thalamus, and 17% in the right anterior cerebellum. In addition to these increases, 6% and 4% decreases in rCBF were detected in the HRA of the right M1 and the bilateral posterior cingulate sulci, respectively. These results demonstrate that perfusion-based fMRI using CASL with a separate labeling coil can now be used to  characterize task-related flow changes in most of the brain volume with adequate  accuracy and sensitivity.
15734360	11	n = 11	Anatomical and functional MRI images were acquired in a group of healthy elderly  subjects (n = 11) and a group of patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease, from mild to moderate severity (n = 8). During functional sessions, verbal episodic Encoding and Recognition tasks were presented to subjects. Both groups were compared in terms of gray matter volume and cerebral activation. Furthermore, in the AD group, correlations between hippocampal gray matter volume and whole-brain activations were examined. When compared to healthy controls, AD  patients presented significant gray matter atrophy as well as reduced activations during Encoding and Recognition in the medial temporal lobes and inferior parietal/superior temporal associative areas. In the same regions, the fMRI activity elicited by the Recognition task was positively correlated with hippocampal gray matter volume. Moreover, an increase of left prefrontal activity during Encoding and Recognition was observed in AD patients relative to controls  and was correlated with memory performance. This additional activity elicited by  episodic memory processes was not found to correlate with the degree of medial temporal atrophy in our group of patients. Our study shows that function in brain regions critical to episodic memory is altered in AD. During episodic Recognition, these functional changes may closely correlate with the progressive  structural changes observed in the hippocampal region.

15737657	20	n = 20	BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is an increasingly recognized psychiatric disorder, linked with impairments in numerous life domains and with neurocognitive dysfunctions. However, the neural substrate  of cognitive functioning in adults with this disorder has been relatively unexamined. The objective of this study was to examine neural functioning in ADHD adults during performance on a verbal working memory task. METHODS: A sample of unmedicated adults with ADHD (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 20) performed a 2-back task of working memory, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response was used as a measure of neural activity during working memory performance. RESULTS: Though working memory performance did not differ significantly between ADHD adults and control subjects, ADHD adults showed significantly decreased activity in cerebellar and occipital regions and a trend toward decreased activation in an a priori predicted region of the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: ADHD adults showed altered patterns of neural activity despite comparable performance on a verbal working memory task. These findings suggest that the cerebellum is involved in the pathophysiology of at least some cognitive deficits associated with ADHD and  emphasize the need for additional research aimed at elucidating the role of the cerebellum in ADHD symptomatology.

15758039	9	n = 9	Impairments in using eye gaze to establish joint attention and to comprehend the  mental states and intentions of other people are striking features of autism. Here, using event-related functional MRI (fMRI), we show that in autism, brain regions involved in gaze processing, including the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region, are not sensitive to intentions conveyed by observed gaze shifts. On congruent trials, subjects watched as a virtual actor looked towards a checkerboard that appeared in her visual field, confirming the subject's expectation regarding what the actor 'ought to do' in this context. On incongruent trials, she looked towards empty space, violating the subject's expectation. Consistent with a prior report from our laboratory that used this task in neurologically normal subjects, 'errors' (incongruent trials) evoked more activity in the STS and other brain regions linked to social cognition, indicating a strong effect of intention in typically developing subjects (n = 9). The same brain regions were activated during observation of gaze shifts in subjects with autism (n = 10), but did not differentiate congruent and incongruent trials, indicating that activity in these regions was not modulated by the context of the perceived gaze shift. These results demonstrate a difference in the response of brain regions underlying eye gaze processing in autism. We conclude that lack of modulation of the STS region by gaze shifts that convey different intentions contributes to the eye gaze processing deficits associated with autism.

15766634	18	n = 18	Functional imaging and neuropsychological data suggest that interconnected brain  structures including the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and caudate nucleus (CN) are involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but structural imaging studies investigating these regions have yielded inconclusive results. This may be due to inconsistencies in the identification of anatomical boundaries and methodologies  utilised (i.e. automated vs. manual tracing). This magnetic resonance imaging study used manual tracing to measure volumes of selected brain regions (OFC, ACC  and CN) in OCD patients and compared them with samples of healthy (HC) and psychiatric (schizophrenia; SCZ) controls (n=18 in each group). Concurrently, automated voxel-based analysis was also used to detect subtle differences in cerebral grey and white matter. For the OCD vs. HC comparison, there were no significant volumetric differences detected using the manual or the automated method (although the latter revealed a deficit in the subcortical white matter of the right temporal region). A direct comparison of the two patient groups showed  no significant differences using the manual method. However, a moderate effect size was detected for OFC grey matter (reduced in SCZ), which was supported by findings of reduced OFC volume in the automated analysis. Automated analyses also showed reduced volumes in the dorsal (white matter) and ventral ACC (grey and white matter), as well as the left posterior cingulate (grey and white matter) in SCZ. The findings suggest that in contrast to findings in SCZ, there are very few (if any) gross structural anomalies in OCD.
15769488	17	n = 17	It is widely assumed that episodic retrieval (recollection) involves reinstatement of cortical activity engaged during the processing of an episode when it was initially experienced. It follows from this assumption that the cortical correlates of recollection should differ with the content of what is recollected, and that retrieval of different content should be associated with activity in functionally distinct cortical regions. The present experiment investigated these predictions. Subjects (N=17) studied a mixed list of words and pictures and were then presented with a test list comprised of words only. Test items were studied words, the names of studied pictures, and unstudied (new) words. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired while the subjects made Remember/Know/New judgments to these test words. Independent of study material, studied items endorsed as Remembered elicited greater activity than correctly classified unstudied items in several regions, including left frontal, left lateral parietal, and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, Remembered items elicited greater activity in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus than items accorded Know judgments, replicating previous findings. Analysis of content-specific effects demonstrated a regional double-dissociation within left  fusiform cortex; recollected words elicited greater activity than recollected pictures in lateral fusiform, whereas the reverse effect was evident in an anterior fusiform region. The lateral and anterior fusiform areas correspond closely to areas held to be functionally specialized for the processing of visual words and pictures, respectively. Thus, the current findings support the cortical reinstatement hypothesis of episodic retrieval.
15808990	100	n = 100	Recent hemodynamic imaging studies have shown that processing of low probability  task-relevant target stimuli (i.e., oddballs) and low probability task-irrelevant novel stimuli elicit widespread activity in diverse, spatially distributed cortical and subcortical systems. The nature of this distributed response supports the model that processing of salient and novel stimuli engages many brain regions regardless of whether said regions were necessary for task performance. However, these latter neuroimaging studies largely employed small sample sizes and fixed-effect analyses, limiting the characterization and inference of the results. The present study addressed these issues by collecting  a large sample size (n = 100) and employed random effects statistical models. Analyses were also conducted to determine the inter-subject reliability of the hemodynamic response and the effects of gender and age on target detection and novelty processing. Group data demonstrated highly significant activation in all  34 specified regions of interest for target detection and all 24 specified regions of interest for processing of novel stimuli. Neither age nor gender systematically influenced the results. These data are discussed within the context of a model that proposes that the mammalian brain has evolved to adopt a  strategy of engaging distributed neuronal systems when processing salient stimuli despite the low probability that many of these brain regions are required for successful task performance. This process may be termed 'adaptive reflexive processing.' The implications of these results for interpreting functional MRI studies are discussed.
15820711	4	n = 4	BACKGROUND: Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated hyperactivity of the  frontal cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); however, relationships between abnormal brain activity, clinical improvement, and neuropsychological function have not been clarified in OCD. To clarify the pathophysiology of this disorder, regional changes in brain function were examined during administration  of cognitive and symptom provocation tasks in patients with OCD before and after  treatment. METHODS: Ten outpatients with OCD participated in the study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed before and after treatment. Stroop and symptom provocation tasks were administered during fMRI. Each patient was randomly allocated to receive either pharmacotherapy with fluvoxamine 200 mg/day (n = 4) or behavior therapy (n = 6) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: After 12-week treatment, mean (+/- SD) total score on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale decreased from 29.00 +/- 3.59 to 14.60 +/- 9.22, representing symptomatic improvement from moderate to mild. After symptom improvement, symptom provocation-related activation in the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral-prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices decreased. Conversely, Stroop task-related activation in the parietal cortex and cerebellum increased. CONCLUSIONS: After improvement of OCD with either fluvoxamine or behavioral therapy, hyperactivation of the frontal lobe related to a symptom-provocative state decreases, and posterior brain activity related to action-monitoring function increases.

15850737	27	n = 27	Allelic variants in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders and personality traits. In  particular, two common alleles in a variable repeat sequence of the promoter region (SLC6A4) have been differentially associated with a display of abnormal levels of anxiety and affective illness in individuals carrying the "s" allele. The aim of this study was to compare the basal cerebral metabolic activity of non-psychiatric subjects in fronto-limbic structures to determine whether differences exist in basal metabolic activity within this functional polymorphism. PET scans with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose as radiotracer were performed in 71 non-psychiatric subjects previously screened for psychopathology  and subsequently genotyped for SLC6A4; PET images were compared with SPM2 according to s/s (n = 27), s/l (n = 25), and l/l (n = 19) groups considering a significance threshold in a priori selected areas of P < 0.001 and an extent threshold > or =5 voxels. The analysis showed an effect of interest among the three genotype groups in right anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), left middle frontal gyrus, and left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC). Comparison between l/l vs. s/s showed increased metabolism for l/l in left middle frontal gyrus and an increase for s/s in right ACC and left PCC. Comparison between s/s vs. s/l showed an increase for s/s in left PCC and right ACC. Increased basal metabolism in fronto-limbic structures for the s/s group may be conceived as an "overactive metabolic state" of these structures, possibly related to an increased susceptibility for developing an anxiety-depression spectrum disorder.

15860342	16	n = 16	BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, the activity of the medial temporal lobe habituates rapidly with the repeated presentation of a stimulus. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested the hypothesis that habituation of the medial temporal lobe is reduced in schizophrenia. METHODS: During fMRI scanning, fearful and happy faces were presented repeatedly to healthy control subjects (n =16) and patients with schizophrenia (n =18). Habituation of medial temporal lobe structures was measured by comparing the hemodynamic response occurring during the early and late portions of the presentation of each face. RESULTS: Control subjects demonstrated significant medial temporal lobe habituation to fearful but not to happy faces. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia did not demonstrate medial temporal lobe habituation in response to fearful or happy faces. In a direct, between-group comparison, right hippocampal  habituation to fearful faces was significantly greater in control subjects than in the schizophrenia patients. Also, there were no significant differences between the patients and control subjects in the early medial temporal lobe response to fearful faces, suggesting that attenuated hippocampal habituation in  schizophrenia is not associated with a reduction in initial activation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is abnormal modulation of hippocampal responses to fearful faces in schizophrenia.

15949653	9	n = 9	Patients with schizophrenia frequently demonstrate hypofrontality in tasks that require executive processing; however questions still remain as to whether prefrontal cortex dysfunctions are specific to schizophrenia, or a general feature of major psychopathology. Context processing is conceptualized as an executive function associated with attention and working memory processes. Impairment in the ability of patients with schizophrenia to represent and maintain context information has been previously reported in a number of studies. To examine the question of the specificity of a context processing deficit to schizophrenia, we used functional MRI and an expectancy AX continuous performance task designed to assess context processing in a group of healthy controls (n=9),  depressed patient controls (n=10), and patients with schizophrenia (n=7). The behavioral performance was consistent with a context processing deficit in patients with schizophrenia, but not those with depression. The imaging data replicate previous results in showing abnormal activity in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA9) in schizophrenia patients related to context processing.

15949654	46	n = 46	BACKGROUND: Abnormal temporal connections with other cortical areas may underlie  some of the most prominent cognitive deficits described in schizophrenia. In order to evaluate the relationship between temporal and other cortical regions in schizophrenia, we examined the intercorrelations of volumetric measures of gray and white matter for each Brodmann's area of the temporal lobe with volumes in the rest of the cortex in patients with schizophrenia and normal comparison subjects. METHODS: MR images were acquired in normal subjects (n=46) and patients with schizophrenia (n=106), divided into good-outcome (n=52) and poor-outcome (Kraepelinian; n=54) subtypes; and correlational patterns between the volumes of  individual Brodmann's areas were compared and examined in relation to outcome. RESULTS: Positive frontotemporal intercorrelations were significantly stronger while negative frontotemporal intercorrelations were weaker in schizophrenia patients as compared to normal subjects. Correlations between the right temporal  pole and other temporal regions were significantly weaker in schizophrenia patients than in controls. When compared to normal controls and good-outcome patients, schizophrenia patients with poor outcomes showed a selective pattern of stronger gray matter correlations between the medial temporal vs. primary visual  and between primary auditory vs. dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, all in the left hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening of positive associations among the temporal and extratemporal (mainly frontal and occipital) regions as well as weakening of regional intercorrelations within the temporal lobe in patients appear to constitute the major differences of correlational patterns in schizophrenia patients and normal subjects. Present findings may be implicated in object recognition deficits seen in patients with schizophrenia, as well as in purportedly deficient spatial and semantic processing of both auditory and visual information that may be associated with poor outcome.

15953488	14	n = 14	BACKGROUND: In the brain, processing of fearful stimuli engages the amygdala, and the variability of its activity is associated with genetic factors as well as with emotional salience. The objective of this study was to explore the relevance of personality style for variability of amygdala response. METHODS: We studied two groups (n=14 in each group) of healthy subjects categorized by contrasting cognitive styles with which they attribute salience to fearful stimuli: so-called phobic prone subjects who exaggerate potential environmental threat versus so-called eating disorders prone subjects who tend to be much less centered around fear. The two groups underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3T during performance of a perceptual task of threatening stimuli and they were also matched for the genotype of the 5' variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the serotonin transporter. RESULTS: The fMRI results indicated that phobic prone subjects selectively recruit the amygdala to a larger extent than eating disorders prone subjects. Activity in the amygdala was also independently predicted by personality style and genotype of the serotonin transporter. Moreover, brain activity during a working memory task did not differentiate the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that aspects of personality style are rooted in biological responses of the fear circuitry associated with processing of environmental information.
15955502	12	n = 12	While there are many reports of reduced amplitude of hemodynamic responses in schizophrenia, there are no reports of delayed hemodynamic responses, in spite of event-related brain potential (ERP) evidence of slowed neural responses. Recently, Henson et al. (2002) [Henson, R., Price, C., Rugg, M., Turner, R., Friston, K., 2002. Detecting latency differences in event-related BOLD responses: application to words versus nonwords and initial versus repeated face presentations. NeuroImage, 15:83-97] proposed a new method for testing small latency effects (<2 s) in hemodynamic responses. fMRI data were collected during  a visual oddball task with infrequent (12%) targets (K) and frequent (88%) standards (X), presented every 1-3 s pseudorandomly, with 7-24 s between targets. SPM99 yielded parameter estimates for the hemodynamic response and its temporal derivative (TD). Beta images reflecting hemodynamic response magnitude to target  stimuli were minimally thresholded (P < 0.05, uncorrected), and latencies were estimated for surviving voxels using TD and hemodynamic response beta values. DSM-IV schizophrenia patients (n = 12) and sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 12) were recruited from the community. Although groups differed only minimally in activation height, hemodynamic responses were significantly delayed in basal ganglia, thalamus, and anterior cingulate in patients with schizophrenia. Psychomotor slowing reflected in reaction times to targets recorded outside the magnet was related to hemodynamic slowing in basal ganglia,  anterior cingulate, thalamus, as well as left cerebellum in controls. Delays in the hemodynamic response have far-reaching implications for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia from slowed neural responses to slowed substrate delivery, and depending of the degree of delay, may raise methodological issues regarding modeling hemodynamic responses in patients and controls.

15990338	42	n = 42	BACKGROUND: Abnormal regional volume intercorrelations between selected cortical  areas in schizophrenia patients were previously reported in several MRI studies.  METHODS: A detailed analysis of frontal gray and white matter volume correlations with Brodmann's area volumes in the rest of the cortex was undertaken in normal subjects (n = 42) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 106), divided into good-outcome (n = 52) and poor-outcome (Kraepelinian; n = 54) subtypes. RESULTS:  Frontal gray matter volumes were correlated with temporal lobe volumes in schizophrenics but not in normal subjects. Some frontal-parietal and frontal-occipital correlations showed a similar pattern. In comparison to normal  subjects, schizophrenia patients showed weaker or absent intercorrelations intrafrontally, specifically between left motor-premotor and eye-movement areas (4, 6, 8) and dorsolateral area 44, as well as between left areas 9 and 46 vs. area 24 (cingulate gyrus). Poor outcome among patients with schizophrenia was associated with weaker correlations between left frontal area 9 and both medial and lateral temporal cortices, as compared to normal subjects or good-outcome patients. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a structural component in the task or  symptom-related dysfunctional interactions between the frontal and more posterior cortical regions with preferential pathological involvement of frontotemporal and more limited involvement of frontoparietal and fronto-occipital systems in schizophrenia. Impaired regional associations within the frontal lobe, between left motor-premotor and Broca's areas, may play a role in language processing deficits in schizophrenia, while frontocingulate disconnection may result in working memory disturbances. Poor outcome may be associated with more widespread  disconnections between prefrontal vs. cingulate and temporal regions in the left  hemisphere, consistent with a disruption along the course of the left cingulum or uncinate bundles.

15993859	12	n = 12	BACKGROUND: The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) is a region implicated in  the assessment of the rewarding potential of stimuli and may be dysfunctional in  major depressive disorder (MDD). The few studies examining prefrontal cortical responses to emotive stimuli in MDD have indicated increased VMPFC responses to pleasant images but decreased responses to sad mood provocation when compared with healthy individuals. We wished to corroborate these results by examining neural responses to personally relevant happy and sad stimuli in MDD and healthy  individuals within the same paradigm. METHODS: Neural responses to happy and sad  emotional stimuli (autobiographical memory prompts and congruent facial expressions) were measured using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in MDD (n = 12) and healthy (n = 12) individuals. RESULTS: Increased and decreased responses in VMPFC were observed in MDD and healthy individuals, respectively, to happy stimuli, whereas the pattern  was reversed for MDD and healthy individual responses to sad stimuli. These findings were not explained by medication effects in depressed individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a double dissociation of the pattern of VMPFC response to happy and sad stimuli in depressed and healthy individuals and  suggest abnormal reward processing in MDD.

16000636	26	n = 26	Converging evidence in neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies has suggested  that the limbic and prefrontal systems play important roles in emotion and cognition. These structures are activated when we see a human face, assuming that we automatically evaluate the biological significance of the stimuli. The serotonin (5-HT) system within the brain has been tied to various behaviors such  as mood and anxiety and to the biology of neuropsychiatric disorders. To investigate the link between the 5-HT system and limbic/prefrontal activity, normal subjects (n = 26) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and  faced recognition tasks were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism C178T in the regulatory region of the serotonin receptor type 3 gene (HTR3A). We  found that the subjects with C/C alleles had greater activity in the amygdala and dorsal and medial prefrontal cortices than those with C/T alleles. The C/C group  also showed a faster reaction time during the task than the C/T group. The temperamental predisposition of the subjects had a significant correlation with brain activity in the C/C group. The genotype effect in the right amygdala and prefrontal cortex was largest during the first run of the experiment. These results indicate that the C178T variation in the HTR3A has a critical influence on the amygdaloid activity and on human face processing, probably through regulation of the receptor expression. The present study may contribute to elucidating a possible link among genes, the brain, and behavior in normal populations and may help reveal the biological basis of neuropsychiatric disorders.
16038681	14	n = 14	BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies report reduced medial prefrontal cortical (particularly anterior cingulate) but enhanced amygdala response to fear signals  in posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). We investigated whether anterior cingulate-amygdala dysregulation in PTSD would generalize to salient, but nonthreat related signals. METHODS: Individuals with PTSD (n = 14) and age and sex-matched nontraumatized controls (n = 14) completed an auditory oddball paradigm adapted to functional magnetic resonance imaging at a 1.5-T field strength. RESULTS: Controls displayed bilateral activation in ventral anterior cingulate and amygdala networks, and PTSD subjects showed bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate and amygdala activation to targets relative to nontargets. Compared to controls, PTSD subjects showed enhanced responses to targets in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate, and left amygdala. Whole-brain analyses confirmed the expected pattern of distributed prefrontal-parietal responses to targets in the oddball task. Greater activity in posterior parietal somatosensory regions was observed in PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of enhanced anterior cingulate responses in PTSD contrast with reports of reduced activity for threat  stimuli, suggesting that the latter may be specific to processing of threat-related content. Activation in rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate, left amygdala and posterior parietal networks in response to salient, nonthreatening stimuli may reflect generalized hypervigilance.

16046149	54	n = 54	This experiment used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare functional neuroanatomy associated with executed and imagined hand movements in novel and skilled learning phases. We hypothesized that 1 week of intensive physical practice would strengthen the motor representation of a hand motor sequence and increase the similarity of functional neuroanatomy associated with executed and imagined hand movements. During fMRI scanning, a right-hand self-paced button press sequence was executed and imagined before (NOVEL) and after (SKILLED) 1 week of intensive physical practice (n = 54; right-hand dominant). The mean execution rate was significantly faster in the SKILLED (3.8 Hz) than the NOVEL condition (2.5 Hz) (P < 0.001), but there was no difference in execution errors. Activation foci associated with execution and imagery was congruent in both the NOVEL and SKILLED conditions, though activation features were more similar in the SKILLED versus NOVEL phase. In the NOVEL phase, activations were more extensive during execution than imagery in primary and secondary cortical motor volumes and the cerebellum, while during imagery activations were greater in the striatum. In the SKILLED phase, activation features within these same volumes became increasingly similar for execution and  imagery, though imagery more heavily activated premotor areas, inferior parietal  lobe, and medial temporal lobe, while execution more heavily activated the precentral/postcentral gyri, striatum, and cerebellum. This experiment demonstrated congruent activation of the cortical and subcortical motor system during both novel and skilled learning phases, supporting the effectiveness of motor imagery-based mental practice techniques for both the acquisition of new skills and the rehearsal of skilled movements.
16051437	7	n = 7	The neural coding of perception can differ from that for the physical attributes  of a stimulus. Recent studies suggest that activity in right anterior insular cortex may underlie thermal perception, particularly that of cold. We now examine whether this region is also important for the perception of warmth. We applied cutaneous warm stimuli on the left leg (warmth) in normal subjects (n = 7) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). After each stimulus, subjects rated their subjective intensity of the stimulus using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and correlations were determined between the fMRI signal and the VAS ratings. We  found that intensity ratings of warmth correlated with the fMRI signal in the right (contralateral to stimulation) anterior insular cortex. These results, in conjunction with previous reports, suggest that the right anterior insular cortex is important for different types of thermal perception.
16084839	10	n = 10	BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the role of immunologic processes, notably cytokines, in the development of behavioral alterations, especially in medically ill patients. Interferon (IFN)-alpha is notorious for causing behavioral symptoms, including depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction, and has been used to investigate the effects of cytokines on the brain. METHODS: In the present study we assessed the effects of low-dose IFN-alpha on brain activity, using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a task of visuospatial attention in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). RESULTS: Despite endorsing symptoms of impaired concentration and fatigue, IFN-alpha-treated patients (n = 10) exhibited task performance and activation of  parietal and occipital brain regions similar to that seen in HCV-infected control subjects (n = 11). Interestingly, however, in contrast to control subjects, IFN-alpha-treated patients exhibited significant activation in the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which highly correlated with the number of task-related errors. No such correlation was found in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the role of the ACC in conflict monitoring, ACC activation during IFN-alpha administration suggests that cytokines might increase processing conflict or reduce the threshold for conflict detection, thereby signaling the need to exert greater mental effort to maintain performance. Such alterations in ACC activity might in turn contribute to cytokine-induced behavioral changes.

16111898	9	n = 9	In synesthesia, stimulation of one sensory modality (e.g., hearing) triggers a percept in another, non-stimulated sensory modality (e.g., vision). Likewise, perception of a form (e.g., a letter) may induce a color percept (i.e., grapheme-color synesthesia). To date, the neural mechanisms underlying synesthesia remain to be elucidated. We disclosed by fMRI, while controlling for  surface color processing, enhanced activity in the left intraparietal cortex during the experience of grapheme-color synesthesia (n = 9). In contrast, the perception of surface color per se activated the color centers in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally. The data support theoretical accounts that grapheme-color synesthesia may originate from enhanced cross-modal binding of form and color. A  mismatch of surface color and grapheme induced synesthetically felt color additionally activated the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This suggests that cognitive control processes become active to resolve the perceptual conflict resulting from synesthesia.
16122946	18	n = 18	General intelligence (g) is a common factor in diverse cognitive abilities and a  major influence on life outcomes. Neuroimaging studies in adults suggest that the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices play a crucial role in related cognitive activities including fluid reasoning, the control of attention, and working memory. Here, we investigated the neural bases for intellectual giftedness (superior-g) in adolescents, using fMRI. The participants consisted of a superior-g group (n = 18, mean RAPM = 33.9 +/- 0.8, >99%) from the national academy for gifted adolescents and the control group (n = 18, mean RAPM = 22.8 +/- 1.6, 60%) from local high schools in Korea (mean age = 16.5 +/- 0.8). fMRI data were acquired while they performed two reasoning tasks with high and low g-loadings. In both groups, the high g-loaded tasks specifically increased regional activity in the bilateral fronto-parietal network including the lateral  prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and posterior parietal cortices. However, the regional activations of the superior-g group were significantly stronger than those of the control group, especially in the posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, regression analysis revealed that activity of the superior and intraparietal cortices (BA 7/40) strongly covaried with individual differences in g (r = 0.71 to 0.81). A correlated vectors analysis implicated bilateral posterior parietal areas in g. These results suggest that superior-g may not be due to the recruitment of additional brain regions but to the functional facilitation of the fronto-parietal network particularly driven by the posterior  parietal activation.

16126414	28	n = 28	Different activation loci have been reported for language processing in unilingual Chinese and unilingual English participants, as well as in bilingual readers of English and French, two alphabetic languages. Nevertheless, the extant imaging work on Mandarin-English bilinguals favors common neural substrates for English and Chinese, languages with contrasting oral and written forms. We investigated the phonological processes in reading for English-Chinese biscriptals using a homophone matching task with parallel behavioral (n = 28) and fMRI (n = 6) experiments. Unlike previous reports, we observed distinct regions of activation for Mandarin in the left and right frontal lobes, the left temporal lobe, and the right occipital lobe, plus distinct regions of activation for English bilaterally in both the frontal and parietal lobes. The implications of these novel findings are discussed with reference to language representation in bilinguals.

16183659	12	n = 12	It is not known whether there is a core abnormality that occurs in all cases of schizophrenia. The cognitive dysmetria hypothesis proposes that there is such an  abnormality which is characterized cognitively by a disruption in control and coordination processes, and functionally by abnormal inter-regional connectivity  within the cortico-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical circuit (CCTCC). In the current study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate these two key aspects of the  hypothesis. Since patients with schizophrenia show deficits in attention which have been characterized extensively using the continuous performance task (CPT) and since functional imaging studies have also demonstrated that this task engages the CCTCC, we used this task to investigate whether two patient groups with distinct symptom profiles would show functional dysconnectivity within this  network. Three groups of subjects participated in the study: healthy volunteers (n = 12), schizophrenia patients with both negative and positive symptoms (n = 11) and schizophrenia patients with primarily positive symptoms (n = 11). Patient groups were matched for age of illness onset and medication, and to the control group for age, gender and handedness. Subjects were scanned using fMRI whilst they performed a modified version of the CPT, involving both degraded and non-degraded stimuli. Stimulus degradation has been shown to produce decrements in sensitivity, which is thought to reflect increased demands on the limited capacity of visual attention. Between-group comparisons revealed that patients with schizophrenia, irrespective of symptomatology, showed attenuation of the anterior cingulate and cerebellar response to stimulus degradation in comparison  with control subjects. We also observed disruptions of inter-regional brain integration in schizophrenia. A task-specific relationship between the medial superior frontal gyrus and both anterior cingulate and the cerebellum was disrupted in both patient groups in comparison with controls. In addition, patients with negative symptoms showed impaired behavioural performance, and abnormal task-related connectivity between anterior cingulate and supplementary motor area. These findings are consistent with theoretical accounts of schizophrenia as a disorder of functional integration, and with the cognitive dysmetria hypothesis, which posits a disconnection within the CCTCC as a fundamental abnormality in schizophrenia, independent of diagnostic subtype. Furthermore, these data show evidence of additional functional deficits in patients with negative symptoms, deficits which may explain the accompanying attentional impairment.

16185668	30	n = 30	BACKGROUND: The ability to accurately detect deception is presently very limited. Detecting deception might be more accurately achieved by measuring the brain correlates of lying in an individual. In addition, a method to investigate the neurocircuitry of deception might provide a unique opportunity to test the neurocircuitry of persons in whom deception is a prominent component (i.e., conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, etc.). METHODS: In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that specific regions were reproducibly activated when subjects deceived. Subjects participated in a mock crime stealing either a ring or a watch. While undergoing an fMRI, the  subjects denied taking either object, thus telling the truth with some responses, and lying with others. A Model-Building Group (MBG, n = 30) was used to develop the analysis methods, and the methods were subsequently applied to an independent Model-Testing Group (MTG, n = 31). RESULTS: We were able to correctly differentiate truthful from deceptive responses, correctly identifying the object stolen, for 93% of the subjects in the MBG and 90% of the subjects in the MTG. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use fMRI to detect deception at the individual level. Further work is required to determine how well this technology  will work in different settings and populations.

16216534	13	n = 13	Effective fear processing relies on the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Post-trauma reactions provide a compelling model for examining how the heightened experience of fear impacts these systems. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with excessive amygdala and a lack of MPFC activity in response to nonconscious facial signals of fear, but responses to consciously processed facial fear stimuli have not been examined. We used functional MRI to elucidate the effect of trauma reactions on amygdala-MPFC function during an overt fear perception task. Subjects with PTSD (n = 13) and matched non-traumatized healthy subjects (n = 13) viewed 15 blocks of eight fearful face stimuli alternating pseudorandomly with 15 blocks of neutral faces (stimulus duration 500 ms; ISI 767 ms). We used random effects analyses in SPM2 to examine within- and between-group differences in the MPFC and amygdala search  regions of interest. Time series data were used to examine amygdala-MPFC associations and changes across the first (Early) versus second (Late) phases of  the experiment. Relative to non-traumatized subjects, PTSD subjects showed a marked bilateral reduction in MPFC activity (in particular, right anterior cingulate cortex, ACC), which showed a different Early-Late pattern to non-traumatized subjects and was more pronounced with greater trauma impact and symptomatology. PTSD subjects also showed a small but significant enhancement in  left amygdala activity, most apparent during the Late phase, but reduction in Early right amygdala response. Over the time course, trauma was related to a distinct pattern of ACC and amygdala connections. The findings suggest that major life trauma may disrupt the normal pattern of medial prefrontal and amygdala regulation.

16284758	9	n = 9	To explicate the neural correlates of sex differences in visuospatial and verbal  fluency tasks, we examined behavioural performance and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) regional brain activity, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, during a three-dimensional (3D) mental rotation task and a compressed sequence overt verbal fluency task in a group of healthy men (n=9) and women (n=10; tested during the low-oestrogen phase of the menstrual cycle). Men outperformed women on the mental rotation task, and women outperformed men on the verbal fluency task. For the mental rotation task, men and women activated areas in the right superior parietal lobe and the bilateral middle occipital gyrus in association with the rotation condition. In addition, men activated the left middle temporal gyrus and the right angular gyrus. For verbal fluency, men activated areas in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, right cingulate gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, thalamus, left parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral lingual gyrus, and women activated areas in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus  and left caudate. Despite observing task related activation in the hypothesised areas in men and women, no areas significantly differentiated the two sexes. Our  results demonstrate comparable brain activation in men and women in association with mental rotation and verbal fluency function with differential performance, and provide support for sex differences in brain-behaviour relationships.

16330505	68	n = 68	The way in which medication overuse transforms episodic migraine into chronic daily headache is unknown. To search for candidate brain areas involved in this process, we measured glucose metabolism with 18-FDG PET in 16 chronic migraineurs with analgesic overuse before and 3 weeks after medication withdrawal and compared the data with those of a control population (n = 68). Before withdrawal, the bilateral thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate gyrus, insula/ventral striatum and right inferior parietal lobule were hypometabolic, while the cerebellar vermis was hypermetabolic. All dysmetabolic areas recovered  to almost normal glucose uptake after withdrawal of analgesics, except the OFC where a further metabolic decrease was found. A subanalysis showed that most of the orbitofrontal hypometabolism was due to eight patients overusing combination  analgesics and/or an ergotamine-caffeine preparation. Medication overuse headache is thus associated with reversible metabolic changes in pain processing structures like other chronic pain disorders, but also with persistent orbitofrontal hypofunction. The latter is known to occur in drug dependence and could predispose subgroups of migraineurs to recurrent analgesic overuse.
